Rails Simple Data Import
========================

This is a simple web app that imports a spreadsheet using the [roo gem](http://roo.rubyforge.org/). Once the spreadsheet is selected the app checks to see if the file is an exceptable format, then uploads the spreadsheet and displays it in a form to be proofed and edited before saving to the database.
